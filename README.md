# **Ochi Design Clone**

This is a **fully responsive, visually interactive webpage** inspired by the Ochi Design website. I built it using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **Locomotive Scroll**. The project focuses on creating smooth animations, interactive elements, and a clean modern design while keeping everything responsive across devices.

### **Features**

* **Landing Page:** Eye-catching hero section with responsive typography.
* **Marquee Section:** Smooth, continuous scrolling banners.
* **About Section:** Stylish and minimal information layout.
* **Interactive Eyes:** Eyes that follow the mouse cursor using React hooks.
* **Featured Projects:** Cards with hover animations using Framer Motion.
* **Clients / Logos:** Grid of partner logos with badges and ratings.
* **Footer:** Clean footer with SVG branding and social links.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Locomotive Scroll enabled for desktops for a sleek scroll experience.

### **Technical Highlights**

* React functional components with **hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`).
* Dynamic **Framer Motion animations** for project highlights.
* Fully responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**.
* **Dynamic pupil movement** in the Eyes section based on cursor position.
* Smooth scrolling experience only on larger screens using **Locomotive Scroll** to avoid crashes on mobile.
* Mobile-first design adjustments to prevent spacing glitches between sections.

### **Purpose**

I built this project to **practice advanced front-end skills**, including animations, responsiveness, and smooth scrolling techniques. Itâ€™s also a showcase of **my design-to-code abilities** and attention to interactive UX.
